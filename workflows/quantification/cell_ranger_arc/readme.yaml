name: Quantify single nucleus multiome assays using Cell Ranger ARC

description: |
  Using `cellranger-arc` software, libraries for snRNA-seq and cell-matched snATAC-seq assays are quantified against an index, which can be optionally created.

tags:
  - 10x
  - quantification
  - multiome

steps:
  - name: Create missing indexes
    description: For datasets that do not have an `index path`, an index is created using the information in the `genome` stanza. The unique set of required indexes are created.

    modules:
      - cell_ranger_arc/count

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameters sets but now include `index path` _and_ `quantification path` parameters.
