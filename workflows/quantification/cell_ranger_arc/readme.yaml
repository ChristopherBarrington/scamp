name: Quantify single nucleus multiome assays using Cell Ranger ARC

description: |
  Using `cellranger-arc` software, libraries for snRNA-seq and cell-matched snATAC-seq assays are quantified against an index, which can be optionally created.

tags:
  - 10x
  - quantification
  - multiome

steps:
  - name: Create missing indexes
    description: For datasets that do not have an `index path`, an index is created using the information in the `genome` stanza. The unique set of required indexes are created.
    anchor: 29
    modules:
      - cell_ranger_arc/mkref

  - name: Create project sample sheet
    description: Write a formatted configuration file that includes all libraries in this project which will be subset for libraries in a dataset.
    anchor: 66
    modules:
      - cell_ranger_arc/make_libraries_csv

  - name: Quantify assays
    description: Use the FastQ files to quantify RNA expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells.
    anchor: 91
    modules:
      - cell_ranger_arc/count

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameter sets but now include `index path`, `quantification method` and `quantification path` keys.

channel tags:
  - ':genome_indexes.missing': Datasets for which the `index path` is missing; indexes will be created for these.
  - ':genome_indexes.provided': Datasets for which the `index path` has been provided.
  - ':index_paths': The indexes that have been created or provided.
  - ':feature_type_params': A channel that collates the project-wide information required to make the Cell Ranger ARC sample sheet.
  - ':datasets_to_quantify': Parameter sets for datasets that will be quantified.
  - ':quantified_datasets': Parameter sets of datasets that were quantified.
  - ':final_result': Input parameters with the `index path` (if applicable), `libraries_csv`, `quantification method` and `quantification path` keys added.
