name: Quantify scRNA-seq expression using Cell Ranger

description: |
  Use the 10X `cellranger` software to quantify expression and optionally create a genome index against which gene expression can be quantified.

tags:
  - 10x
  - quantification
  - rna

steps:
  - name: Make genome index
    description: Use `cellranger mkref` to make an index against which expression can be quantified using `fasta file` and `gtf file`. The output index is named using the `id` key.
    anchor: 27
    modules:
      - cell_ranger/mkref

  - name: Quantify expression
    description: Run `cellranger count` to align and quantify gene expression using the FastQ files and a genome index.
    anchor: 61
    modules:
      - cell_ranger/count

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameters sets but now include `quantification method` and `quantification path` keys.
  - name: tasks
    type: channel
    description: Concatenation of all task's parameters and process software versions.

channel tags:
  - ':genome_indexes.missing': Datasets that do not have an `index path`, the unique set of indexes are created from `fasta file` and `gtf file`.
  - ':genome_indexes.provided': Datasets that have an `index path` so do not need further work.
  - ':index_paths': A channel of index paths for the genomes in the project.
  - ':datasets_to_quantify': Dataset parameters passed into the workflow, subset for relevant keys.
  - ':quantified_datasets': After quantification, the `quantification path` key is added to the parameters.
  - ':result': The new parameters from the workflow are merged back into the input parameters, with a `quantification method` key added. The channel is emitted from the workflow as `result`.
  - ':tasks': Each task's output `task.yaml` files from the `task` channel.
