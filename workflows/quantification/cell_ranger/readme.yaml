name: Quantify scRNA-seq expression using Cell Ranger

description: |
  Use the 10X `cellranger` software to optionally create a genome index against which gene expression can be quantified.

tags:
  - 10x
  - quantification
  - rna

steps:
  - name: Quantify expression
    description: Run `cellranger count` to align and quantify gene expression using the FastQ files and a genome index.
    anchor: 34
    parameters:
      - key: unique id
        description: For the `tags` channel, to output in the Nextflow log.
        type: string
      - key: limsid
        description: Sample name, used in the module to search `fastq paths` for the relevant FastQ files.
        type: string
      - key: fastq paths
        description: Collection of directories that are search for `limsid` samples.
        type: paths
      - key: index path
        description: Path to the index against which expression will be quantified.
        type: path
      - key: dataset id
        description: Filename-safe name for the dataset that can be used to publish results. This will be derived from the key if not provided.
        type: string
    modules:
      - cell_ranger/count

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameters sets but now include `index path` _and_ `quantification path` parameters.
