name: Protocols to quantify gene expression

description: |
  A variety of methods are implemented that can take FastQ files and output quantified expression data, creating intermediate files such as indexes as required.

tags:
  - quantification

steps:
  - name: Quantify datasets
    description: Datasets are grouped according to the presence of `quantification/*` in the `stages`. Quantification workflows are dispatched accordeing to the stage.
    anchor: 22
    workflows:
      - quantification/cell_ranger
      - quantification/cell_ranger_arc

output:
  - name:  all_results
    type: channel
    description: A parameters channel with datasets now including `quantification path` and `quantification method` parameters.

channel tags:
  - ':quantification.cell_ranger': Datasets that include a `quantification/cell_ranger` stage.
  - ':quantification.cell_ranger_arc': Datasets that include a `quantification/cell_ranger_arc` stage.
  - ':quantification.unknown': Any datasets that contain an as-yet unimplemented quantification method.
  - ':result': Channel containing all of the parameters with new keys added.
