name: Protocols to quantify gene expression

description: |
  A variety of methods are implemented that can take FastQ files and output quantified expression data, creating intermediate files such as indexes as required.

tags:
  - quantification

steps:
  - name: Quantify datasets
    description: Datasets are grouped according to the presence of `quantification/*` in the `workflows`. Quantification workflows are dispatched according to the workflow values.
    anchor: 24
    workflows:
      - quantification/cell_ranger
      - quantification/cell_ranger_arc
      - quantification/cell_ranger_multi

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A parameters channel with datasets now including `quantification path` and `quantification method` parameters.
  - name: tasks
    type: channel
    description: Concatenation of all task's parameters and process software versions.

channel tags:
  - ':quantification.cell_ranger': Datasets that include a `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
  - ':quantification.cell_ranger_arc': Datasets that include a `quantification/cell_ranger_arc` workflow.
  - ':quantification.cell_ranger_multi': Datasets that include a `quantification/cell_ranger_multi` workflow.
  - ':quantification.unknown': Any datasets that contain an as-yet unimplemented quantification method.
  - ':result': Channel containing all of the parameters with new keys added.
  - ':tasks': Each task's output `task.yaml` files from the `task` channel.
