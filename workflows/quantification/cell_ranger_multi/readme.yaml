name: Quantify single nucleus multiome assays using Cell Ranger ARC

description: |
  Using `cellranger-multi` software, barcoded and probe-based libraries for gene expression assays are quantified against an index, which can be optionally created.

  # - name: Create missing indexes
  #   description: For datasets that do not have an `index path`, an index is created using the information in the `genome` stanza. The unique set of required indexes are created.

  - name: Create anlaysis configuration file
    description: Write a formatted configuration file that includes all libraries in this project which will be subset for libraries in a dataset.

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameter sets but now include `quantification method` and `quantification path` keys.

  - name: tasks
    type: channel
    description: Concatenation of all tasks' parameters and process software versions.

channel tags:
  # - ':genome_indexes.missing': Datasets for which the `index path` is missing; indexes will be created for these.
  # - ':genome_indexes.provided': Datasets for which the `index path` has been provided.
  # - ':index_paths': The indexes that have been created or provided.
  - ':configuration_params': Channel containing information of which samples and assays are in each library.
  - ':libraries_to_quantify': Paths to the newly-created configuration files for each library.
  - ':quantified_datasets': Parameter sets of libraries that were quantified into datasets.
  - ':result': Input parameters with the `index path` (if applicable), `config_file`, `quantification method` and `quantification path` keys added.
  - ':tasks': Each task's output `task.yaml` files from the `task` channel.
