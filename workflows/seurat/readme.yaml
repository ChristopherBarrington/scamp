  - name: Create a Seurat object
    description: Datasets are split into two channels according to presence of the `seurat file` parameter. The `seurat/prepare` workflow for the `quantification method` is used to create an object.
    anchor: 23
    workflows:
      - prepare/cell_ranger
      - prepare/cell_ranger_arc

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A parameters channel with datasets now including the parameters provided by workflows.
  - name: tasks
    type: channel
    description: Concatenation of all task's parameters and process software versions.

channel tags:
  - ':quantified_by.cell_ranger': Channel of datasets for which a Seurat oject is required and was quantified by Cell Ranger.
  - ':quantified_by.cell_ranger_arc': Cell Ranger ARC-qauntified datasets that do not have a `seurat file`.
  - ':quantified_by.unknown': Datasets that lack both `seurat file` and `quantification method`.
  - ':result': The parameters channels with workflow parameters included.
  - ':tasks': Each task's output `task.yaml` files from the `task` channel.
