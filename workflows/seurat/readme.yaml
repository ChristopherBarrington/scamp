    workflows:
      - prepare/cell_ranger
      - prepare/cell_ranger_arc

output:
  - name:  final_results
    type: channel
    description: A parameters channel with datasets now including the parameters provided by workflows.

channel tags:
  - 'quantified_by.cell_ranger': Channel of datasets for which a Seurat oject is required and was quantified by Cell Ranger.
  - 'quantified_by.cell_ranger_arc': Cell Ranger ARC-qauntified datasets that do not have a `seurat file`.
  - 'quantified_by.unknown': Datasets that lack both `seurat file` and `quantification method`.
  - 'final_results': The parameters channels with workflow parameters included.
