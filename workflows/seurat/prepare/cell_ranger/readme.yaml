name: Prepare Seurat from Cell Ranger

description: |
  Using the filtered single cell expression matrix, output from Cell Ranger, a Seurat object is prepared with little modification.

tags:
  - 10x
  - seurat
  - gene expression

steps:
  - name: Make GRanges object
    description: A GRanges object is created for each genome in the project using the GTF file in the `index path`. This will be saved into the Seurat object's `misc` slot later in the workflow. 
    anchor: 43
    modules:
      - R/GenomicRanges/convert_gtf_to_granges

  - name: Connect to biomaRt
    description: Create a biomaRt connection for each genome, matching to the Ensembl release. This object will be added to the Seurat object's `misc` slot later in the workflow. **This functionality should be in separate "genome_preparation" workflow.**
    anchor: 72
    modules:
      - R/biomaRt/get_mart

  - name: Read Cell Ranger output into assays
    description: "Read the Cell Ranger `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` and save the result, ready to create assay(s). Two RNA assays are created for each dataset: one using features indexed by accession and another by feature name."
    anchor: 98
    modules:
      - R/Seurat/write_10x_counts_matrices
      - R/Seurat/make_assay

  - name: Create Seurat object
    description: Collect the miscellaneous data and assays and create a Seurat object, saved as an RDS file.
    anchor: 159
    modules:
      - R/Seurat/make_object

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameters sets but now include `index path` _and_ `quantification path` parameters.

parameters:
  - key: genome
    description: The name of the genome used for the dataset.
    type: string
    providers:
      user: genome
  - key: index path
    description: Path to the index that against which the dataset was quantified, which provides the genes GTF file and genome FastA index. If not provided in the parameters, it should have been created by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
    type: path
    providers:
      user: index path
      process: quantification/cell_ranger/mkref
  - key: organism
    description: Scientific name of the species, specified in the `_project/genomes` stanza. For example, "mus musculus".
    type: string
    providers:
      user: organism
  - key: ensembl release
    description: The Ensembl release number that is most relevant (ideally matching) the provided index.
    type: numeric
    providers:
      user: ensembl release
  - key: unique id
    description: An identifier for the analysis and dataset that is used as the task's tag.
    type: string
    providers:
      user: unique id
      default: stage name and dataset name
  - key: quantification path
    description: Path to the Cell Ranger `outs` directory under which `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` can be found. If not provided in the parameters, this sould be provided by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
    type: path
    providers:
      user: quantification path
      process: quantification/cell_ranger/count
  - key: feature identifiers
    description: Whether to use `accession` or `name` as the feature index. The non-selected identifier is saved into an `RNA_alt` assay in the object.
    type: string
    providers:
      user: feature identifiers
  - key: dataset name
    description: A human-readable name for the dataset that will be used as the Seurat `Project`. If not provided in the parameters, the dataset key will be used.
    type: string
    providers:
      user: dataset name
      default: dataset key in parameters file
  - key: dataset id
    description: A filesystem-safe dataset name. {scamp} will try to convert the dataset name if not provided.
    type: string
    providers:
      user: dataset name
      default: parsed dataset name
