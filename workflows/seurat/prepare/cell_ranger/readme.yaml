name: Prepare Seurat from Cell Ranger

description: |
  Using the filtered single cell expression matrix, output from Cell Ranger, a Seurat object is prepared with little modification.

tags:
  - 10x
  - seurat
  - gene expression

steps:
  - name: Make GRanges object
    description: A GRanges object is created for each genome in the project using the GTF file in the `index path`. This will be saved into the Seurat object's `misc` slot later in the workflow. 
    anchor: 43
    parameters:
      - key: genome
        description: The name of the genome used for the dataset.
        type: string
      - key: index path
        description: Path to the index that against which the dataset was quantified. If not provided in the parameters, it should have been created by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
        optional: true
    modules:
      - R/GenomicRanges/convert_gtf_to_granges

  - name: Connect to biomaRt
    description: Create a biomaRt connection for each genome, matching to the Ensembl release. This object will be added to the Seurat object's `misc` slot later in the workflow. **This functionality should be in separate "genome_preparation" workflow.**
    anchor: 72
    parameters:
      - key: genome
        description: The name of the genome used for the dataset.
        type: string
      - key: organism
        description: Scientific name of the species, specified in the `_project/genomes` stanza. For example, "mus musculus".
        type: string
      - key: ensembl release
        description: The Ensembl release number that is most relevant (ideally matching) the provided index.
        type: numeric
    modules:
      - R/biomaRt/get_mart

  - name: Read Cell Ranger output into assays
    description: "Read the Cell Ranger `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` and save the result, ready to create assay(s). Two RNA assays are created for each dataset: one using features indexed by accession and another by feature name."
    anchor: 98
    parameters:
      - key: unique id
        description: An identifier for the analysis and dataset that is used as the task's tag.
        type: string
        optional: true
      - key: index path
        description: Path to the index that against which the dataset was quantified. If not provided in the parameters, it should have been created by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
        type: path
        optional: true
      - key: quantification path
        description: Path to the Cell Ranger `outs` directory under which `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` can be found. If not provided in the parameters, this sould be provided by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
        type: path
        optional: true
    modules:
      - R/Seurat/write_10x_counts_matrices
      - R/Seurat/make_assay

  - name: Create Seurat object
    description: Collect the miscellaneous data and assays and create a Seurat object, saved as an RDS file.
    anchor: 159
    parameters:
      - key: feature identifiers
        description: Whether to use `accession` or `name` as the feature index. The non-selected identifier is saved into an `RNA_alt` assay in the object.
        type: string
        optional: true
      - key: dataset tag
        description: A short name for the dataset so that cell barcodes can be informatively appended with this tag rather than a number.
        type: string
      - key: dataset name
        description: A human-readable name for the dataset that will be used as the Seurat `Project`. If not provided in the parameters, the dataset key will be used.
        type: string
        optional: true
      - key: dataset id
        description: A filesystem-safe dataset name. {scamp} will try to convert the dataset name if not provided.
        type: string
        optional: true
    modules:
      - R/Seurat/make_object

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameters sets but now include `index path` _and_ `quantification path` parameters.
