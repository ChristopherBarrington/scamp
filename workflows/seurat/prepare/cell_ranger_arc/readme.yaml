name: Prepare Seurat from Cell Ranger ARC

description: |
  Using the filtered single nucleus expression and accessibility matrices, written by Cell Ranger ARC, a Seurat object is prepared that contains RNA and chromatin accessibility assays with little modification.

tags:
  - 10x
  - seurat
  - multiome

steps:
  - name: Make GRanges object
    description: A GRanges object is created for each genome in the project using the GTF file in the `index path`. This will be saved into the Seurat object's `misc` slot later in the workflow. 
    anchor: 42
    parameters:
      - key: genome
        description: The name of the genome used for the dataset. This is used as the task's tag and in the `cellranger-arc mkref` configuration file.
        type: string
      - key: index path
        description: Path to the index that against which the dataset was quantified, which provides the genes GTF file and genome FastA index. If not provided in the parameters, it should have been created by the `quantification/cell_ranger_arc` workflow.
        type: path
        optional: true
    modules:
      - R/GenomicRanges/convert_gtf_to_granges

  - name: Read Cell Ranger ARC output into assays
    description: "Read the Cell Ranger ARC `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` and save the result, ready to create assay(s). Two RNA assays are created for each dataset: one using features indexed by accession and another by feature name. An additional chromatin accessibility assay is created, for which accession and name are the same since they are genomic intervals."
    anchor: 71
    parameters:
      - key: unique id
        description: An identifier for the analysis and dataset that is used as the task's tag.
        type: string
        optional: true
      - key: index path
        description: Path to the index that against which the dataset was quantified. If not provided in the parameters, it should have been created by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
        type: path
        optional: true
      - key: quantification path
        description: Path to the Cell Ranger `outs` directory under which `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` can be found. If not provided in the parameters, this sould be provided by the `quantification/cell_ranger` workflow.
        type: path
        optional: true
    modules:
      - R/Seurat/write_10x_counts_matrices
      - R/Seurat/make_assay
      - R/Signac/make_chromatin_assay

  - name: Create Seurat object
    description: Collect the miscellaneous data and assays and create a Seurat object, saved as an RDS file.
    anchor: 161
    parameters:
      - key: feature identifiers
        description: Whether to use `accession` or `name` as the RNA feature index. The non-selected identifier is saved into an `RNA_alt` assay in the object.
        type: string
        optional: true
      - key: remove barcode suffixes
        description: (R) boolean as to whether the numeric suffixes of cell barcodes should be removed. These get messy with multiple integrations and could be replaced by the short dataset tag.
        type: string
      - key: dataset name
        description: A human-readable name for the dataset that will be used as the Seurat `Project`. If not provided in the parameters, the dataset key will be used.
        type: string
        optional: true
      - key: dataset id
        description: A filesystem-safe dataset name. {scamp} will try to convert the dataset name if not provided.
        type: string
        optional: true
    modules:
      - R/Seurat/make_object

output:
  - name: result
    type: channel
    description: A channel of maps that are the same as the input parameters sets but now include a `seurat path` parameter.
