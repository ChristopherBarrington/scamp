name: Prepare Seurat from Cell Ranger ARC

description: |
  Using the filtered single nucleus expression and accessibility matrices, written by Cell Ranger ARC, a Seurat object is prepared that contains RNA and chromatin accessibility assays with little modification.

tags:
  - 10x
  - seurat
  - multiome

steps:
  - name: Read Cell Ranger ARC output into assays
    description: "Read the Cell Ranger ARC `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` and save the result, ready to create assay(s). Two RNA assays are created for each dataset: one using features indexed by accession and another by feature name. An additional chromatin accessibility assay is created, for which accession and name are the same since they are genomic intervals."
