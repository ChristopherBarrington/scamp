        The method used to create the data in `quantification path`. This is a curated set of methods and depends on the analysis stages: `cell_ranger` and `cell_ranger_arc` for example. This will be provided by {scamp} if a quantification stage is applied, otherwise it is required.
      type: string
      provider: process

    - name: fasta path
      description: A directory with FastA files that can be used to create a genome index. When provided, the files in the directory will be concatenated together into a genome FastA.No default is provided but is probably only needed to build an index.
      type: path

    - name: fasta file
      description: Genomic sequence in FastA format. Can be provided by the `fasta path` option. This parameter takes precedence over the `fasta path` parameter.
      type: file
      provider: process

    - name: gtf path
      description: A directory with GTF files that can be used to quantify activity of features. The files in this directory will be concatenated into a single GTF file and the result used in `gtf file`. No default is provided but is probably only needed to build an index.
      type: path

    - name: gtf file
      description: GTF file of features in the genome. This parameter will be used in preference to the `gtf path`.

      type: string
      provider: default

    - name: genomes
      description: A dictionary of genomes included in the project. These should be very similar across projects and use standard values. The values may be dependent on other project parameters; the index used for alignment and quantification may be linked to `ensembl release` for example.
