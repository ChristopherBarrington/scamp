      type: string
      provider: default
    - name: analysis name
      description: A human-readable name for an analysis. This should not be applied at the dataset-level within an analysis stanza but could be specified in the `_defaults` for an analysis. The default is the YAML key used in the {scamp} parameters file.

      provider: default
    - name: analysis id
      description: A directory safe identifier for the analysis. The default value is an attempt to make the `dataset name` directory-safe.

    - name: quantification method
      description: |
        The method used to create the data in `quantification path`. This is a curated set of methods and depends on the analysis stages: `cell_ranger` and `cell_ranger_arc` for example. This will be provided by {scamp} if a quantification stage is applied, otherwise it is required.
      type: string
      provider: process
    - name: fasta files
      description: A collection of FastA files that can be used to create a genome index. No default is provided but is probably only needed to build an index.
      type: files
    - name: gtf files
      description: A collection of GTF files that can be used to quantify activity of features. No default is provided but is probably only needed to build an index.

      type: string
      provider: default
    - name: genomes
      description: A dictionary of genomes included in the project. These should be very similar across projects and use standard values. The values may be dependent on other project parameters; the index used for alignment and quantification may be linked to `ensembl release` for example.
